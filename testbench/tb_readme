### **tb_top.sv**
- Top-level integration testbench.
- Instantiates the interface and DUT.
- Calls write test → read test → compares readback.
- Final PASS/FAIL based on functional readback.

### **tb_axi_lite_write.sv**
- Drives a single-beat AXI4-Lite write.
- AWLEN = 0, WLAST = 1, AWSIZE = 3 (64-bit).
- Verifies AW/W/B handshake.
- Verifies BRESP == OKAY.
- Performs memory post-write checking inside the slave.

### **tb_axi_lite_read.sv**
- Drives a single-beat AXI4-Lite read.
- ARLEN = 0, RLAST assumed internally.
- Verifies AR/R handshake.
- Verifies RRESP == OKAY.
- Returns 64-bit read data to caller.



The testbench for reads:
Drives read address signals on the manager side
ARADDR = 0xFFFFFFFF, ARVALID = 1 (master requests read)

Simulates the slave’s readiness by controlling ARREADY.

Scenarios tested:
1. Master asserts ARVALID while slave is not ready -> ARVALID = 1 ARREADY = 0. No handshake should occur.
2. Slave remains not ready for multiple cycles
3. Slave becomes ready
4. ARVALID deasserts after handshake

The testbench for writes:

WRITE PATH (AXI4-Lite) – Testbench Overview

The AXI4-Lite write testbench performs the following:

Drives a single-beat write transaction

AWLEN = 0

WLAST = 1

Full 8-byte WSTRB

INCR burst type (AXI-Lite compliant)

AW/W/B handshake verification

AWVALID → AWREADY

WVALID → WREADY

BVALID → BREADY

Checks BRESP

Ensures correct OKAY response (2’b00)

Verifies memory write

Reads back 8 bytes from dut.mem[]

Compares with the expected data

This ensures correct behavior of the write datapath, including address acceptance, write-data acceptance, and generation of a write response.

// Self Check Testbench for read

The communication for a read operation involves two distinct channels: the Read Address Channel (AR) and the Read Data Channel (R). 
The manager initiates the transaction, and the subordinate responds, adhering to the standard AXI handshake principle (VALID and READY).

*** Tested on 3 Scenarios
1. Basic Read Check (Mapped Address)
2. Read Decode Error Check
3. Sequential Read Accesses
