This document provides an overview of the AXI4-Lite SystemVerilog testbench, its structure, simulation flow, supported test scenarios, and how to extend/debug it.

The top_tb module verifies an AXI4-Lite Manager (Master) and Subordinate (Slave) pair using directed + corner-case stimulus.

It uses:
AXI4-Lite Interface (axi4_if)
Manager → DUT (manager.sv)
Subordinate → DUT (axi_subordinate.sv)
TB Interface (TB_if.sv) for driving internal manager signals

The primary goal of this TB is to exercise protocol behavior, corner cases, and error response handling (BRESP/RRESP).

Testbench Architecture: 

axi4_if	AXI4-Lite interface connecting Manager ↔ Subordinate
TB_if	Custom interface used to inject AW/W/AR transactions
manager	DUT manager module (generates AXI transactions)
axi_subordinate	AXI4-Lite slave memory model

The TB provides two key reusable tasks.

do_write(addr, data) which drives:

AW channel (manager_tx_AW)
W channel (manager_tx_W)
Enables AW + W using tx_en
Waits for B-channel
Prints result: PASS/FAIL


do_read(addr) which drives:

AR channel
Waits for R-data
Prints result: PASS/FAIL
Both tasks automatically sync to the ACLK.

Test Scenarios Implemented

The TB runs a sequence of AXI-Lite corner cases, including:

Aligned Write + Read -> Valid 64-bit aligned access
Misaligned Access
Boundary Condition
Out-of-Range Access
Back-to-Back AW/W and AR Sequences
Write → Immediate Read Hazard
Partial Write Strobes
